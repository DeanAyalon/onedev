# Purpose
This repository manager my self-hosted [OneDev](https://onedev.io) server, containing my private repositories and packages

# Use 
This repository is part of the [dean-server](https://github.com/deanayalon/dean-server) monorepo, and is supposed to be managed from there. 
>That said, the conainer could also run standalone, but would require a proxy, as it does not map ports to host
